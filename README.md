**llv**__emscr__**wasm**__npm__**java**__type__**script**__abi__**codec**__js__**ir**sdk is a universal ahead-of-just-in-time transdiscomping code suite and dis-co-integrated development kit targeting:

- Ada
- The Java 6 JVM
- TypeScript Minu (numberical tyes  always rendered as ordinals, rather than quantities)
- Objective-F++#,
- ksh93 shell scripts.

In a nutshell, this is accomplished by via one of two accepable indermediary representations: invalid UTF-8 byte sequences, or, Elizabethen Standard English. Note, that the primary target devices at this stage of development are TI-8x graphing calculators and Casio calculator watches.
